## Overview

The Impact Scholars Program is designed to support scientists in continuing and expanding on the research projects initiated during Neuromatch and CLimatematch Academy, including Computational Neuroscience, Deep Learning, NeuroAI, and Computational Tools for Climate Science. This six-month program fosters a long-term commitment to research by providing students with invaluable hands-on research experiences that enhance their academic and professional development.

## Objectives

The program aims to:

- Address the demand within our Academy community for immersive research experiences that extend beyond the short-term projects completed during the courses. 
- Enhance scholarsâ€™ computational research skills and knowledge in specific sub-domain of neuroscience, deep learning, NeuroAI, or climate science.
- help the scholars chart their path from data to action.
