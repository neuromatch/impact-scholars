# Presentation guidelines

## Session format
Each [seminar session](.impact-scholars/seminar_presentations.md) will feature 3-4 teams of Impact Scholars. 

Every team will deliver a **10-minute talk** followed by a moderated Q&A. 

The last 30 minutes of each session will be dedicated to networking between the scholars and scientists. For Climatematch Academy, this includes representatives from our collaborating organizations, [CMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/) and [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/). For Neuromatch Academy, the collaborating organizations will be announced soon. 

The presentation part of each session will be open to the public and recorded. Recordings will be made available on the [Climatematch Academy Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ClimatematchAcademy-uq9vr/videos), the [Neuromatch Academy Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@neuromatchacademy7117/videos), and their [program website](https://impact-scholars.neuromatch.io/impact-scholars/scholars2023.html) soon after the events.

## Specific presentation requirements
- Talks should be **10 minutes** long and accompanied by **slides** (check out ["Ten simple rules for effective presentation slides"](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009554))
- Groups should **mention the data** they used in their projects and include a slide about their **experience working with the data** (what did you find helpful? what did you struggle with?)
- Climatematch groups using CMIP data should add the **CMIP logo** to their presentations (you can get a high resolution logo [here](https://wcrp-cmip.org/branding/))
- All team members and the mentor should be **acknowledged by name** in the presentation slide deck. We additionally encourage the groups to include a team photo on the first or the last slide provided that everyone feels comfortable with it. 

We leave it up to the scholars to allocate the speaking responsibilities among themselves. While everyone who wishes to present part of the talk should be given a chance to do so, it is allowed for one scholar to speak on behalf of the team.
