# Micropublications

```{admonition} Workshop
The workshop will cover a range of best (micro)publication practices - from communication clarity to author credit assignment. It will be an opportunity to ask questions and receive feedback on specific research outputs. 

To get the most out of the workshop, we ask that the scholars come prepared with:
- a description of the work they are doing - it does not need to be a formal abstract at this point
- a rough figure - it does not need to be polished, but it should be understandable with a legend/labels
- a breakdown of who has done what - the scholars need not have looked at [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/) already, but should be able to explain what everyone's roles are

The workshop will be held twice to accommodate as many scholars as possible.
- **18 December 2023**: 18:30-20:00 UTC
- **20 December 2023**: 14:00-15:30 UTC

See the cisp-community channel on Discord for a link to the sign-up form!

## Submission Form
We require all teams to submit a micropublication at the end of the program using [this form](https://airtable.com/appLHqbcnAQ1EUO47/shrfR7WzpKqGPBu3W). 

### Deadline
12 January, 2024

## Submission guidelines

The form requires specific components in your micropublication submission. Here are some guidelines for each of the components:

### Title
A single line which provides the gist of the research conducted
  
### Type of research
Each micropublication should provide evidence to support **one** specific:
  - claim,
  - observation, or
  - method

Please choose one of the above 3 options.

### A summary for the general public
All teams are expected to submit a short summary of their research that can be easily grasped by a non-scientific audience. 
  - This summary will be shared on our website and social media to make your research more accessible and to help your research have greater *impact*. 
  - You are welcome to submit a text summary (~150 words) or choose a more creative format (such as videos, comics, poems, songs) to communicate your research findings. The public summary should be easy to understand irrespective of which format you choose.
  - Format : please avoid using proprietary data formats for your creative submissions.
  - For inspiration, checkout some of the following resources:
    - [Cartoonists tackling climate change through webcomics](https://www.dw.com/en/cartoonists-tackling-climate-change-through-webcomics/a-63499432)
    - [Rajan lab comics](https://www.rajanlab.com/comics)
    - [Dance your PhD](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dance+your+phd)

### Author Contributions
We request all the teams to track author contributions using the [CRediT taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org). Click on each of the 14 contributor roles to see what they constitute. We discourage giving credits to a scholar (including any former teaching assistant) or mentor if they haven't contributed to the project at all. 
- Format: .csv, .ods, or .tsv
- Templates: We are providing 2 templates to track author contributions throughout the program. **Each team is required to submit author contributions in one of these 2 formats.** Download one of the following templates for your team:
  - [CISP_contributors_table_template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140bNO83-GkOP1SYXWLpZmY27a5wxtj97gOR-5CaMXDQ/edit?usp=sharing): This template was adopted from [tenzing.club](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/tenzingclub). 
  - [CISP_contributors_table_template_granular](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fw34ZjKaZQ9iv6ld6YT1kZP2uyg0CbmJIZdM88tb07E/edit?usp=sharing): This is a replica of the previous template with more granularity added for each role. There are 2 types of contributions to choose from:
    - Lead: If a scholar has made major contributions in a role, choose this option. Multiple people can have this role.
    - Support: If a scholar has primarily provided support and feedback or helped with brainstorming but hasn't made major contributions to the role, choose this option.
  - Feel free to leave blanks for Roles that aren't relevant for your team.
  - Please use the Notes column to let us know of any specifics that aren't captured in the 14 categories, such as additional roles or other degrees of contribution.
    
### Main Text
Based on the type of research, please elaborate on the single claim, observation, or method. Think of this section as the combination of the Methods, Results, and Discussion sections of a journal-style research article. 
  - Word limit: 1500 words
  - Format: markdown (i.e. a .md or .markdown file). Please refer to [this official guide](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for details on this open format.
  - To make the results reproducible, authors may add supplementary methods if the 1500 word limit isn't sufficient to report the steps to reproduce the results.
  - References : Please add external links to any references directly in the main text using the markdown format of [inline-style links](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link) where the link text in square brackets is immediately followed by the link in parentheses. Wherever possible please add DOIs for the citations. References are not included in the word count.
      
### Figure
Support your claim, observation, or method with **a single figure**.
  - Format: .svg or .png
  - You can add up to 6 panels to this figure.
  - Please be mindful of avoiding colors (such as red, especially in combination with green or black) that are commonly not visible to people with color blindness. We encourage you to try tools like the [Color Blindness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator) to check the accessibility of the figure. If possible, use shapes instead of colors to disambiguate objects.
  - If you've run simulation(s) and feel that a video or gif may be more informative, please feel free to add that instead of a figure.

### Figure Legends
Add figure legends for each of the panels within the single figure.
  - Please add the figure legend directly in the text box.
  - If you've uploaded a video instead of a figure, please describe the video.
 
### Code
Please include any relevant code that can be used to reproduce the figure.
  - Format: .zip 
  - Each code can be in the form of separate file(s) such as a jupyter notebook, jupyter book, or other code file(s).
  - Code written in a proprietaty software format or language will not be accepted. We require the code to be open source.
  - Do provide a ReadMe.md file with clear instructions on how to run the code and how to access the data.
  - Data : Please also provide clear instructions in the code on how to access the data used to conduct the research.
  - You are welcome to add a link to your code's repository in the ReadMe.md file but we require all code to be submitted as well.

### Optional - Supplementary material
Use this to upload any additional information relevant to your research output. 
  - While we expect the micropublication submission to be in English, we encourage scholars to use this section to submit the micropublication or parts of the micropublication (such as the summary for the general pubic) in other languages. You can submit this translated material even after the micropublication deadline using [this form](https://airtable.com/appLHqbcnAQ1EUO47/shrGDjPoLROYhRsHh).
  - If you are submitting more than 1 file, please upload them together in a .zip file.
