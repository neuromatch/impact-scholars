## Submission guidelines

The form requires specific components in your micropublication submission. Here are some guidelines for each of the components:

### Title
A single line which provides the gist of the research conducted
  
### Type of research
Each micropublication should provide evidence to support **one** specific:
  - claim,
  - observation, or
  - method

Please choose one of the above 3 options.

### A summary for the general public
All teams are expected to submit a short summary of their research that can be easily grasped by a non-scientific audience. 
  - This summary will be shared on our website and social media to make your research more accessible and to help your research have greater *impact*. 
  - You are welcome to submit a text summary (~150 words) or choose a more creative format (such as videos, comics, poems, songs) to communicate your research findings. The public summary should be easy to understand irrespective of which format you choose.
  - Format : please avoid using proprietary data formats for your creative submissions.

### Author Contributions
We request all the teams to track author contributions using the [CRediT taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org). Click on each of the 14 contributor roles to see what they constitute. We discourage giving credits to a scholar (including any former teaching assistant) or mentor if they haven't contributed to the project at all. 
- Format: .csv, .ods, or .tsv
- Templates: We are providing 2 templates to track author contributions throughout the program. **Each team is required to submit author contributions in one of these 2 formats.** Download one of the following templates for your team:
  - [CISP_contributors_table_template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/140bNO83-GkOP1SYXWLpZmY27a5wxtj97gOR-5CaMXDQ/edit?usp=sharing): This template was adopted from [tenzing.club](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/tenzingclub). 
  - [CISP_contributors_table_template_granular](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fw34ZjKaZQ9iv6ld6YT1kZP2uyg0CbmJIZdM88tb07E/edit?usp=sharing): This is a replica of the previous template with more granularity added for each role. There are 2 types of contributions to choose from:
    - Lead: If a scholar has made major contributions in a role, choose this option. Multiple people can have this role.
    - Support: If a scholar has primarily provided support and feedback or helped with brainstorming but hasn't made major contributions to the role, choose this option.
  - Feel free to leave blanks for Roles that aren't relevant for your team.
  - Please use the Notes column to let us know of any specifics that aren't captured in the 14 categories, such as additional roles or other degrees of contribution.

### Main Text
Based on the type of research, please elaborate on the single claim, observation, or method. Think of this section as the combination of the Methods, Results, and Discussion sections of a journal-style research article.
