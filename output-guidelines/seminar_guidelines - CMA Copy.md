## Registering for the seminars
The [seminar schedule](./seminar_presentations.md) has been optimized based on the timeslot preferences scholars provided in the Entry Survey, so we expect the majority of scholars to attend their team's session regardless of whether they are speaking in the presentation. 

We highly encourage scholars to attend the seminar sessions of other teams as well. It will be a great opportunity to learn about your peers' research and ask questions.

Scholars **must sign up** for every seminar they intend to attend, including the session assigned to their own team, by filling out the respective registration forms [here](./seminar_presentations.md). 
The scholars who sign up for the seminar session their team is presenting at are automatically registered for the networking session with researchers from [CMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/) and [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/) that will take place immediately after the presentations.

Note that it was not always possible to accommodate the timeslot preferences of everyone in a team. If your group's session falls during your night-time, we can sign you up for the networking part of another session as long as there is a time that works for you. Let us know by tagging `@CISP organizers` on Discord or email `outreach@climatematch.io`.
