# Seminar presentations

The first cohort of Climatematch Impact Scholars shared their work in a series of seminars chaired by scientists from our collaborating organizations, [**CMIP**](https://wcrp-cmip.org/) and [**LEAP**](https://leap.columbia.edu/). 

These seminars were <u>open to the public</u>.

The <u>last 30 minutes of each event</u> were dedicated to networking sessions between the presenting scholars and scientists from CMIP and LEAP.
