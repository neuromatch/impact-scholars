# Program structure

The Impact Scholars program runs between **October 2024** and **March 2025**.

## **What is involved**
- üíª**Computing resources**. Selected groups will be provided with computing resources until the end of the program with a possibility of further extension if the scholars and their mentor are interested in working towards a peer-reviewed publication. 

- üìù **Citable micropublication**. At the end of the program, the scholars will write up their results in a [micropublication](../output-guidelines/micropublications.md) that will be publicized on the program website and assigned a DOI. The scholars will also be offered a chance to share their work in their native language to increase its impact in their community.

- üó£Ô∏è **Seminar presentation**. Also at the end of the program, the scholars will give a 20-minute [virtual seminar](../output-guidelines/seminar_presentations.md) that will be advertised on Neuromatch social media and recorded for subsequent sharing on the course website.

- ü¶â **Mentorship**. We endeavour to match every team to a suitable mentor who connects with the scholars synchronously and asynchronously at least twice a month and provides guidance, support, and feedback on their research outputs. 

- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë**Community support**. There will be regular check-ins from the program organisers on the ***#cisp-community*** forum channel on the Climatematch‚Äôs Discord Community Server and on the
***#NMA-isp-community*** forum channel on the Neuromatch's Discord Community Server for participants to share both successes and struggles.

We are actively working to provide participants with further professional and academic opportunities and additionally encourage them to take part in the Academies seminars, journal club meetings, and professional development survey series. These are not strictly part of the program, but are aligned with the scholars' project topics and career aspirations.
