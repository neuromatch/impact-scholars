# Summary for the general public

All teams are expected to submit a short summary of their research that can be easily grasped by a non-scientific audience. 
  - This summary will be shared on our website and social media to make your research more accessible and to help your research have greater *impact*. 
  - You are welcome to submit a text summary (~150 words) or choose a more creative format (such as videos, comics, poems, songs) to communicate your research findings. The public summary should be easy to understand irrespective of which format you choose.
  - Format : please avoid using proprietary data formats for your creative submissions.
