# Program Structure

The Impact Scholars program runs between **October 2024** and **March 2025**. The program is designed to be **part-time**, requiring approximately 3 hours a week. Regular participation and consistent progress are expected to ensure meaningful contributions to the project group.

## **What is involved**

- 💻**Computing resources**. Selected groups will be provided with computing resources until the end of the program with a possibility of further extension if the scholars and their mentor are interested in working towards a peer-reviewed publication. Climatematch scholars will have access to the Climatematch JupyterHub, while Neuromatch scholars will receive Colab Pro access. 

- 📝 **Citable micropublication**. At the end of the program, the scholars will write up their results in a [micropublication](../output-guidelines/micropublications.md) that will be publicized on the program website and assigned a DOI. The scholars will also be offered a chance to share their work in their native language to increase its impact in their community.

- 🦉 **Mentorship**. We endeavour to match every team to a suitable mentor who connects with the scholars synchronously and asynchronously at least twice a month and provides guidance, support, and feedback on their research outputs. 

- 🗣️ **Seminar presentation**. Also at the end of the program, the scholars will give a 20-minute [virtual seminar](../output-guidelines/seminar_presentations.md) that will be advertised on Neuromatch and Climatematch social media and recorded for subsequent sharing on the Academies website.

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑**Community support**. There will be regular check-ins from the program organisers on the ***#isp-community*** forum channel on the Climatematch’s and Neuromatch's Discord Community Server for participants to share both successes and struggles.

We are actively working to provide participants with further professional and academic opportunities. Stay tuned for more information!
