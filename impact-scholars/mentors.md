# Mentors

Mentors are **experienced scientists who are interested in supporting a group throughout the development of their research project** between October 2024 and March 2025 nd will be compensated for their time and effort.

## Why be a mentor? 

Mentors will also become official collaborators on the project which will conclude with submission of a micropublication and a seminar presentation by the project teams. If there is mutual interest in continuing the collaboration on the project beyond the end of the program, we will do our best to support work towards a publication in a scientific journal by facilitating continued, uninterrupted provision of the computing resources to the scholars.
