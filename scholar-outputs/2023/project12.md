In Colombia's fields, small farms take flight,<br>
El Niño and La Niña, nature's delicate might.<br>
Coffee's dance with warmth, a surprising song,<br>
La Niña's rain, in rhythm, along.<br>

Figures whisper, correlations unfold,<br>
ONI and SPI, a story told.<br>
In the CESM's gaze, the future unfurls,<br>
A climatic waltz, in changing swirls.<br>

El Niño, once foe, now a coffee's friend,<br>
La Niña's embrace, droughts amend.<br>
Yet, in recent years, a shift in the air,<br>
El Niño's rise, a tale to bear.<br>

In this agro-poetic refrain, lessons unfurl,<br>
A dance with nature, a resilient swirl.<br>
