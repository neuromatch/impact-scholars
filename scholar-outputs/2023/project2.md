In the tempest of climate's exchange,<br>
Hurricane surges pose challenges, strange.<br>
As the storms dance with glee,<br>
Rising tides taunt the sea,<br>
Measuring their might, in flux, a range.<br>

For sea heights, a system profound,<br>
Needs remote and in-situ, all around.<br>
With observations remote,<br>
And in-situ, afloat,<br>
Accurate measures in waves are found.<br>

From the ocean, where measurements align,<br>
UHSLC and ECCO, both shine.<br>
With gauges on the coast,<br>
And satellites boast,<br>
Accurate heights, in data they twine.<br>

In Fall's embrace, Maria did soar,<br>
A hurricane mighty, waves did implore.<br>
With waves quite so high,<br>
Above the mean sea, oh my,<br>
NWS sought truth on the shore.<br>

Accurate info, they plead and demand,<br>
For Maria's surge, like a forceful hand.<br>
2.35 to 5.44 meters it rose,<br>
A tale that Puerto Rico knows,<br>
In storm surge data, their safety is planned.<br>

In Isabel Segunda, waves gauge with pride,<br>
Tidal dance in Esperanza's tide.<br>
Arecibo stands tall,<br>
Mayaguez hears the call,<br>
Fajardo's gauge, where sea levels bide.<br>

Years '92 to '17, ECCO's seas,<br>
Surface heights dancing with gentle ease.<br>
Rolling means in the tide gauge,<br>
Pearson correlation, a data stage,<br>
In the waves of comparison, both aim to please.<br>

Round ECCO grid cells, a tale to unfold,<br>
Transformed into an array, so bold.<br>
With plots to compare,<br>
In data's vibrant lair,<br>
A visual dance, a story to be told.<br>

In the dance of tide gauges, so fine,<br>
Selecting a spot, a perfect align.<br>
ECCO grid cells embrace,<br>
Daily averages in grace,<br>
Acceptable errors, in data they twine.<br>

Pearson correlation, a link so bright,<br>
ECCO and tidal gauges unite.<br>
In climate's crystal ball,<br>
And hurricane's squall,<br>
Prediction's key for the future's insight.<br>
