# Workshops 

To help scholars succeed during the program and strengthen their skills, we are offering ***five exclusive workshops*** that will significantly enhance their abilities in essential research areas. These workshops are exclusively available to scholars and are not open to the general public. Each workshop will be *video recorded*, so scholars can revisit them later if unable to attend live. However, **we strongly encourage live attendance** for hands-on learning and to benefit from practical examples.

## Additional Opportunity:
In addition to these exclusive workshops, Neuromatch and Climatematch also offer an [Open Science 101 Course](https://neuromatch.io/open-science-101-course/), which will run at different times throughout the year. While this course is not limited to scholars, we strongly recommend attending as it complements the skills learned in the workshops and will provide valuable insights into open science practices.
