# Git & GitHub Workshop

## Overview
Open Sсience is a practice of making research products and processes available to all, which fosters collaborations, reproducibility, and equity. GitHub is an established and convenient platform for sharing your data, code (as a method), and results with the community. It is also crafted to facilitate efficient interaction with your lab mates for joint contributions. It uses Git under the hood - a version control system which simplifies
In this workshop, we will learn how to use Git commands for creating and managing so-called repositories (where you store the materials); we will play around with branching and merging to empower you with collaborative techniques. We will then make the connection between local changes and a remote repository, located in GitHub, for others to see what you are working on and contribute on top of your findings. We will finish by exploring open-source repositories and how you can contribute to the computational tools today!

Hey! I’m Hlib Solodzhuk, a recently graduated undergrad from Ukrainian Catholic University in IT & Business Analytics. I'm also excited to be part of the team that created the NeuroAI and NASA Open Science courses at Neuromatch Academy - nice to meet you! I believe efficient collaboration is crucial for welcoming the research scientific environment and observing the power of GitHub usage in crafting the courses. I would love to share these tools with you during the workshop.
