# Micropublication workshop


The Micropublication Workshop is designed to ensure that all scholars are well-prepared to create and submit their micropublications. 
During this workshop, we will:

1. Walk scholars through all the necessary steps outlined in the micropublication guidelines, including writing, structuring, and formatting the work.
2. Go over the submission forms and address any questions about the requirements, templates, or deadlines.
3. Answer any questions and clarify any uncertainties to help scholars stay on track with their submission.


This workshop will be run by **the Neuromatch and Climatematch Team**.
